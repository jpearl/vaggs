      <tr><td>TRFS is a system to aid Air Traffic Controllers in a particular tower 
      in fulfilling taxi route requests from pilots at their airport. 
      Currently pilots radio to the tower to ask for a route, the controller 
      speaks a route to the pilot, and the pilot reads back the route to the controller. 
      When many planes are scheduled for departure in a short time window, this eats up 
      a significant amount of time over the radio and forces the controller to repeat his 
      commands multiple times per minute. It also forces the pilot to remember the assigned route.</br></br>
      
    TRFS helps alleviate some of these problems by allowing a controller to send a visual 
    representation of a taxi route to a pilot. The controller no longer needs to speak the
     same route over and over, freeing up valuable time which could be spent paying more attention 
     to the safety on the taxiways themselves. The pilot also has the route on display at all times it is still needed.
