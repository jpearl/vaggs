Business Logic Questions:
========================
Do we need an audit trail?
	if yes, then need to keep exact flight info for a route and not just transponder code and need to store route requests
Level of authentication for ATC and Cockpit?
	problem is if "pilot" impersonator requests new route
	or if an "atc" impersonator gives out false routes


App Engine Questions/Technical Questions
========================================
include multiple jsp files in a single servlet page?
in Airport, should center be the computed average of sw and ne corners?
properties file for API key?
Taxiway intersection Class encapsulates Waypoint? (depends how ATC creates a route)
